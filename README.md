## üìå Project Overview

Authentication with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** is crucial for modern applications. This Kanban board securely verifies user credentials, manages token-based sessions, and protects API access. Users are redirected appropriately based on authentication status, and tokens are securely stored and managed in the client.

## üîê Key Authentication Features

- Secure login with JWT
- Tokens stored in client-side `localStorage`
- Token verification on protected routes
- Automatic logout on inactivity or token expiry
- Redirects for unauthenticated users
- Logout functionality clears session and token

## üíª Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React + TypeScript
- React Router
- Axios for API requests

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express
- TypeScript
